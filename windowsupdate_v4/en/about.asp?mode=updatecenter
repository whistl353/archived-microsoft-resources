				<b>How do I know if I need an update?</b><br />
				Windows Update scans your computer and provides you with a tailored selection of updates that apply only to the items on your computer. During the scan, a list of categories appears under Welcome to Windows Update and the number of updates that are available in each category is noted in parentheses.<br /><br />
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>Critical Updates are important!</b><br />
				Any update that is critical to the operation of your computer is considered a "Critical Update," and is automatically selected for installation during the scan for available updates. These updates are provided to help resolve known issues, and to protect your computer from known security vulnerabilities. Whether a critical update applies to your operating system, software programs, or hardware, it is listed in the &quot;Critical Updates&quot; category.<br /><br />
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>How does it all work?</b><br />
				Follow a simple, three-step process to get the updates you need to keep your computer up-to-date:<br />
				<ol>
					<li>When you enter Windows Update, click <b>Scan for updates</b>.</li>
					<li>As you browse through the available updates in each category, click <b>Add</b> to select the update of your choice and add it to the collection of updates you want to install. You can also read a full description of each item by clicking the <b>Read more</b> link.</li>
					<li>When you have selected all the updates you want, click <b>Review and install updates</b>, and then click <b>Install Now</b>.</li>
				</ol>
				<b><b>Note</b></b> Some updates may require that you restart your computer. Save your work and close any open programs before beginning the installation process.<br /><br />
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>Have questions about an update?</b><br />
				Each update is accompanied by a brief description and a <b>Read more</b> link. Click <b>Read more</b> at any time to view information that is specific to each update. Included in this information are system requirements and, if applicable, instructions on how to use and how to uninstall the update.<br /><br />

		<a name="privacypolicy" class="aboutHeader">Windows Update Privacy Statement (Last Updated 10/17/2003)</a><br />
		Windows Update is committed to protecting your privacy. To provide you with the appropriate list of updates, Windows Update must collect a certain amount of configuration information from your computer. None of this configuration information can be used to identify you. This information includes:<br />
		<ul type="square">
			<li>Operating-system version number</li>
			<li>Internet Explorer version number</li>
			<li>Version numbers of other software for which Windows Update provides updates</li>
			<li>Plug and Play ID numbers of hardware devices</li>
			<li>Region and Language setting</li>
		</ul>
		The configuration information collected is used only to determine the appropriate updates and to generate aggregate statistics. Windows Update does not collect your name, address, e-mail address, or any other form of personally identifiable information.<br /><br />
		Windows Update also collects the Product ID and Product Key to confirm that you are running a validly licensed copy of Windows. A validly licensed copy of Windows ensures that you will receive on-going updates from Windows Update. The Product ID and Product Key are not retained beyond the end of the Windows Update session, unless the Product ID is not valid.<br /><br />
		To provide you with the best possible service, Windows Update also tracks and records how many unique machines visit its site and whether the download and installation of specific updates succeeded or failed. In order to do this, the Windows operating system generates a Globally Unique Identifier (GUID) that is stored on your computer to uniquely identify it. The GUID does not contain any personally identifiable information and cannot be used to identify you. Windows Update records the GUID of the computer that attempted the download, the ID of the item that you attempted to download and install, and the configuration information listed above.<br /><br /><br />
		<a class="aboutHeader" name="windowscatalog">Windows Update Catalog</a><br />

		During the download process, you will be prompted to choose the location where you want to save the downloaded files. Enter a UNC (Universal Naming Convention) path to a pre-existing folder, or click the Browse button on the Download List page to select a location. This UNC path will be used as the root directory. It can be a directory path on your local machine or on a machine on your network. Subdirectories are created for each downloaded component.<br /><br />
		For example: If you create a directory called <b>C:\Updates</b><br /><br />
		A download of a selected software component creates a subdirectory<br /><b> \[Software]\[Locale]\[Platform]\[PackageName].[PackageVersion]</b><br /><br />
		A download of drivers creates a subdirectory<br /><b> \[Driver]\[Locale]\[Platform]\[PackageName].[PackageVersion]</b><br /><br />

				<b>Why do I get a message saying an ActiveX control on this page is not safe?</b><br />
