<br>
<b>What is an ActiveX control? </b><br>
ActiveX controls are software components that incorporate Microsoft ActiveX ® technology. These components can be used to add specialized functionality, such as animation or pop-up menus, to Web pages, programs, and software development tools. Windows Update uses ActiveX controls to check what software is installed on your computer, in order to provide you with a correct list of updates and other software you may want to download.<br>
<br>
<b>What is the best resolution for viewing the Windows Update site? </b><br>
The pages on the Windows Updates site were designed to be viewed at 800 by 600 or higher screen resolution. To set this resolution, right-click the desktop, click Properties, and then click the Settings tab.<br>
